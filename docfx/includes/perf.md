### Object serialization comparisons

Each stacked bar shows the time taken to serialize and deserialize an object.
The two times added together represent round-trip time.

In messagepack, an object may be serialized as a map of property names and values, or as an array of just values.

Some libraries are absent from some comparisons because they don't support a particular format.
