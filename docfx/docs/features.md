# Features

* Serializes in the compact and fast [MessagePack format](https://msgpack.org/).
* [Performance](performance.md) is on par with the highly tuned and popular MessagePack-CSharp library.
* Automatically serialize any type annotated with the [PolyType `[GenerateShape]`](xref:PolyType.GenerateShapeAttribute) attribute
  or non-annotated types by adding [a 'witness' type](type-shapes.md#witness-classes) with a similar annotation.
* Fast `ref`-based serialization and deserialization minimizes copying of large structs.
* NativeAOT and trimming compatible.
* Serialize only properties that have non-default values (optionally).
* Keep memory pressure low by using async serialization directly to/from I/O like a network, IPC pipe or file.
* [Streaming deserialization](streaming-deserialization.md) for large or over-time sequences.
* Primitive msgpack reader and writer APIs for low-level scenarios.
* Author custom converters for advanced scenarios.
* Security mitigations for stack overflows.
* Optionally serialize your custom types as arrays of values instead of maps of names and value for more compact representation and even higher performance.
* Support for serializing instances of certain types derived from the declared type and deserializing them back to their original runtime types using [unions](unions.md).
* Optionally [preserve reference equality](xref:Nerdbank.MessagePack.MessagePackSerializer.PreserveReferences) across serialization/deserialization.
* Structural (i.e. deep, by-value) equality checking for arbitrary types, both with and without collision resistant hash functions.

[^1]: Nerdbank.MessagePack's approach is more likely to be correct by default and more flexible to fixing when it is not.
[^2]: Although MessagePack-CSharp does not support .NET 8 flavor NativeAOT, it has long-supported Unity's il2cpp runtime, but it requires careful avoidance of dynamic features.
[^3]: See our [unity doc](unity.md) for instructions.
[^4]: MessagePack-CSharp is limited to derived types that can be attributed on the base type, whereas Nerdbank.MessagePack allows for dynamically identifying derived types at runtime.
