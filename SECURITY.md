# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

While this library is in prerelease, all servicing of security vulnerabilities will be applied on the latest available version and will not be backported.
After going stable, servicing will typically be applied to the latest stable x.y version as well as the latest prerelease version (where applicable).

| Version | Supported          |

Servicing of older stable versions is available by request with a support agreement or one-time payment.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the security tab on this repo to privately and securely report vulnerabilities.
This gives us a chance to review the report, author a fix and publish a patched version before the vulnerability is made public.
